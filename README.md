A dashboard app from the ZTM Udemy course that displays card items on the web page, and these items represent different robots and thier basic info. The app features a search bar at the top of the page, which allows for the scroll of the cards as a list. The app fetches the robots images from a web site 'https://robohash.org/' and the random id objects from 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users'. The app was created using the React framework.
